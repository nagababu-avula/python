#Quotation in Python
#Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

#The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal âˆ’

word = 'OneWord '
sentence = "This is a sentence. "
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. 
It has multiple lines and sentences. """

print(word)
print(sentence)
print(paragraph)

# or 
print(word); print(sentence); print(paragraph)
